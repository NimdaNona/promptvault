**Product Requirements Document (PRD) for PromptVault**

**1\. Document Overview**

**1.1 Purpose**

This PRD outlines the requirements for building PromptVault, an AI-powered web application that enables users to store, organize, version, optimize, and share prompts for large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini. The app targets AI enthusiasts, content creators, developers, and teams seeking efficient prompt management to reduce trial-and-error in AI workflows.

The PRD is designed for implementation by Claude Code, an AI coding agent, assuming full development and engineering responsibilities. The tech stack prioritizes feasibility for a solo developer: Next.js for the frontend/backend (optimized for Vercel hosting), Vercel Postgres or Supabase for the database (integrated via Vercel), Clerk for authentication, OpenAI API for AI features, and Stripe for payments. Deployment will use Vercel, with GitHub for version control (main branch auto-deploys to production).

This document is comprehensive, actionable, and self-contained to enable Claude Code to build, test, deploy, and iterate on the MVP without additional clarification.

*   **Database**: Vercel Postgres (free tier for MVP; scalable). Schema: Users, Prompts (with versions as child table), Tags, Shares.
*   **Authentication**: Clerk (Vercel integration; handles sessions, webhooks).
*   **AI Integration**: OpenAI SDK (API keys stored in Vercel env vars).
*   **Payments**: Stripe (webhooks for subscriptions; Vercel-compatible).
*   **Hosting**: Vercel (serverless functions, edge caching).
*   **Other**: Tailwind CSS for styling; React Hook Form for inputs; Drizzle ORM for DB queries.

**6.2 System Diagram**

*   Frontend: Next.js pages (e.g., /dashboard, /prompt/\[id\]).
*   Backend: API routes (/api/prompts) for CRUD; Server Actions for secure ops.
*   Data Flow: User → Clerk Auth → Next.js → Vercel Postgres/OpenAI → Response.
*   Deployment: GitHub repo → Vercel (main branch = prod; branches = previews).

**6.3 Vercel-Specific Considerations**

*   Use Vercel CLI for init/deploy: vercel --prod links to GitHub.
*   Integrations: Enable Vercel Postgres via dashboard; add Clerk/Stripe via Vercel Marketplace.
*   Env Vars: Store API keys in Vercel (e.g., OPENAI\_API\_KEY).
*   Best Practices: Use Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) for dashboards; serverless for AI calls to handle spikes.

**7\. UI/UX Guidelines**
