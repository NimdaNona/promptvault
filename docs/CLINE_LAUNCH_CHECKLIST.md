## Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Variables
Ensure all required environment variables are set in Vercel:
```
DATABASE_URL=<pooled-neon-url>
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=<clerk-secret>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<openai-key>
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=<vercel-blob-token>
```

### 2. Database Migrations
```bash
# Generate migrations if needed
npm run db:generate

# Apply migrations
npm run db:migrate
```

### 3. Build Verification
```bash
# Local build test
npm run build

# Type checking
npm run typecheck

# Linting
npm run lint
```

### 4. Vercel Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to preview
vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

### 5. Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Test import flow on production
- [ ] Verify analytics are being collected
- [ ] Check error reporting is working
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise post-deployment:

1. **Immediate Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Revert to previous deployment
   vercel rollback
   ```

2. **Feature Flag Disable**
   - Set `DISABLE_CLINE_IMPORT=true` in Vercel env vars
   - This will hide the import option without full rollback

3. **Data Recovery**
   - Import sessions are tracked in database
   - Failed imports can be retried
   - No data loss for partial imports

## Monitoring Setup

### 1. Vercel Analytics
- Monitor function execution times
- Track error rates
- Watch memory usage

### 2. Application Metrics
- Import success rate
- Average processing time
- Error distribution
- User engagement

### 3. Alerts
- Set up alerts for:
  - Error rate > 10%
  - Processing time > 30s
  - Memory usage > 450MB
  - Failed background jobs

## Communication Plan

### 1. User Announcement
- Blog post about new Cline import feature
- Email to existing users
- In-app notification

### 2. Documentation Updates
- Update main documentation
- Add to feature list
- Create tutorial video

### 3. Support Preparation
- Train support team
- Create FAQ document
- Prepare troubleshooting guide
